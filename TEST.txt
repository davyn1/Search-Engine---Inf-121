"ACM" was very helpful because it helped us realize we weren't lowercasing our queries
"Lisa Frank" was the general term I used to get multiple word queries to work at all
"holy moly" was used to learn that I didn't implement search intersection correctly because "moly" only shares one page with "holy"
"to be or not to be" was the biggest speed test as it's mostly stop words and repeated words. I had to make sure that we weren't doing duplicate query terms
"cristina lopes" was giving errors but it's because of a setting with BeautifulSoup that we had to learn
"master of software engineering" is just a good long phrase that sets a average time estimate of our searches
